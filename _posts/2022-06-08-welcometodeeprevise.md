Welcome !

My project is to share one page for every important topic / concept I meet while a review my basic deep learning knowledge.
Every topic should consist of two pages, one for study where all the knowledge is available and one to review, where a portion of the content has to be completed.
Over time study pages should be improved as my understanding progresses or with the contribution of the community. 
Also additional review pages could be defined by myself or by anyone else :)
